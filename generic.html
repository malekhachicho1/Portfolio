							Assistive and Interactive Device for visaully impaired persons <br />
							using machine learning
						</h1>
						<p> With the growing number of visually impaired individuals, there's a critical need for improved assistive technology. This paper proposes a novel device to address this gap. Current solutions often lack real-time customization and force dependence on others. This project aims to empower users to navigate independently through a new device. The paper details the development process and successful testing results, including object detection with high accuracy (ranging from 63% to 95% for various objects), user interface displaying navigation details and current location, and implementation of vibration feedback for obstacle detection with intensity based on distance (turned off at talking distance, typically under 10cm). This device has the potential to significantly improve the independence, safety, and quality of life for visually impaired people.</p>

					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>With emerging new technologies being on an exponential rise and rapid development, witnessed, is an evolution of smart devices, from being limited to some users and devices to being available almost everywhere. With this evolution came notable advancements in the medical field, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-RAY machines, Laparoscopy and various other machines and technologies. Unfortunately, assistive aid devices for persons with various medical conditions such as persons with visual impairment did not evolve at the same rate. Sight defection, also known as visual impairment or vision loss, is a disorder characterized by a partial or complete loss of the capability to see and perceive visual information. According to the Laser Eye Surgery Hub (LESH), as of 2020, it is estimated that 2.2 billion people are living with visual impairment, 237 million people suffer from moderate or severe vision impairment, 39 million people are completely blind, and it is expected to reach 115 million people in 2050.</p>
					<h3>problem statement</h3>
					<p>Sight-defected people often face daily challenges and limitations, navigating the world where the sense of sight, which most people take for granted, is not an option and unfortunately absent, leading to hardships and barriers, unique for most of the world. Although current assistive technologies are helpful, they frequently fall short in offering real-time solutions that can be tailored to each person's unique needs. The creation of assistive and interactive device that can thoroughly address these issues and improve the independence, safety, and quality of life for people with visual impairments is urgently needed.</p>
					<h3>Aim of the work</h3>
					<p>In this project, we aim to develop a new device that helps visually impaired persons navigate the world independently and to provide them with a new substitute for the sense they were deprived of or lost in the past. Using this product, a visually impaired individual can regain most of his/her privacy by not relying on others to guide them to navigate the world and do other basic tasks that we take for granted while guaranteeing their safety, and protection.</p>
					<h3>Machine learning results</h3>	
					<div class="image fit"><img src="images/ml.png" alt="" /></div>
					<h4>Confusion matrix</h4>
					<p>
						•
						The model correctly classified 0.74 images containing benches as benches. <br/>
						•
						The model correctly classified 0.63 images containing trash bins as trash bins. <br/>
						•
						The model correctly classified 0.95 images containing warnings as warning.
					</p>
					<h4>results summary</h4>
					<p>
						•
						Loss graphs: <br/>
						i.
						The training loss (train/box_loss, train/cls_loss, and train/dfl_loss) appears to be decreasing over time, which is encouraging. This means that the model is learning to better predict bounding boxes, classify objects, and determine the presence of objects in images.<br/>
						ii.
						The validation loss (val/box_loss, val/cls_loss, and val/dfl_loss) appears to decrease over time, indicating that the model generalizes well to new data.<br/>
						•Precision and Recall graphs: <br/>
						i.Precision (metrics/precision(B)): the graph begins around 0.6 and gradually increases to around 0.85.<br/>
						ii.Recall (metrics/recall(B)): the graph begins around 0.55 and gradually increases to around 0.75.<br/>
						•Mean Average Precision (mAP) graphs:<br/>
						i.Mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95): In the graph (metrics/mAP50(B) and metrics/mAP50-95(B)), the graph begins at around 0.35 and gradually rises to around 0.65.
